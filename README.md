# RFID_Simulation Model
Simulation Model for RFID Localization System
## Run Simulation
```
SimulationVeify.m
```
### Run SimulationVeify.m to load simulated states, groundtruth states, and plot figures;
### In SimulationVeify.m, change sim = 1 for 1D simulation ; sim = 2 for 2D simulation;

## Generate GroundTruth States
```
groundtruth1D.m
```
```
groundtruth2D.m
```
Parameters in the two scripts can be changed corresponding to motion you want to simulate
Also, ground truth states can also be loaded with .m files
